## Introduction to NoSQL Databases

# Database: A database is defined as an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically.

Purspose of Database is to keeep your information organised and easily accessible.

# SQL Database: It is a type of database that stores information in a relational way. The data is stored in tables and the tables have predefined relationships with each other.
The relational data model avoids data redundancy by storing linked information across the tables. 

# NoSQL Databases: It is a type of database that stores data in a non tabular form.
Different type of NoSQL Databases may include:
    • Document Database
    • Key-Value Database
    • Graph Database 
    • Wide Column Oriented Databses

## MongoDB

MongoDB is a type of Document NoSQL Database. It stores data as field valiue pairs inside a document. Many such documents are stored under a collection. These collections are what that the database stores. 

Relational Darabases have schema. This is a fixed structure that is defined beforehand. Document Databases like MongoDB are "schema-less", thus they have a flexible structure. Hence, we can say they are polymorphic.

Changes can be made easily to an individual document structure as a new field value pair is added. This maked it Horizontally and Vertically "scalable".

In general, sata is stored more efficiently in MongoDB than in SQL because of its schema-less structure, resulting in less data redundancy and more efficiency.

Documents in MongoDB uses JSON format. 
Eg.: {
    "_id": "100001",
    "customer.name": "Shri Radhey Mishra",
    "phoneNumber": [ "9870977883", "7983744120" ],
    "address": {
        "street": "Kankhal",
        "town": "Haridwar",
        "postCode": "249408"
    }
}

## NOTE ## Field names should be consistent.

DataTypes for values in MongoDB are:
    • Numerical: Numbers such as integers and decimals
    • Date: Date and time values
    • String: Character/ text values
